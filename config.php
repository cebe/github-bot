Thank you for putting effort in the improvement of the Yii framework. 
We have reviewed your pull request.

We came to the conclusion that this pull request in it's current form is covering too many different objectives.
The bigger it is, the more difficult it is to review and accept it. 

Please divide your pull request into separate pull requests with clear objectives.

Thanks!

Thank you for putting effort in the improvement of the Yii framework. 
We have reviewed your pull request.

In order for the framework and your solution to remain stable in the future, we have a unit test requirement in place. Therefore we can only accept your pull request if it is covered by unit tests. 

Could you add these please?

Thanks!

P.S. If you have any questions about the creation of unit tests? Don't hesitate to ask for support. [More information about unit tests](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/guide-test-unit.html)

Thank you for putting effort in the improvement of the Yii framework.

Unfortunately a use case is missing. It is required to get a better understanding of the pull request and hels us to get the necessity and applicability of the suggested change to the framework.

Could you supply us with a use case please? Please be as detailed as possible and show some code!

Thanks!
